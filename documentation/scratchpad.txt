Defining Methods

  A simple method declaration looks like:
  
    method helloworld [
      result := 'Hello World!'
    ]
    
  A method with parameters (and pre- and postconditions) looks like this:
  
    method between(a,b) [ 
    
      assert(a:Number and b:Number)
      
      result := this > a and this < b
      
      assert(result:Boolean)
      
    ]
