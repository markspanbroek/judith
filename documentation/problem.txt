problem:

object Position := Object |[

  object x := 0
  object y := 0

  method create(x,y) [
    # how to assign values x and y?

    # maybe:
    result := self.create
    result.setX(x)
    result.setY(y)
    # ugly and unnecessary complex

    # this would be nice:
    result := self.create
    result.x := x
    result.y := y
    # but would violate the condition that you should self.something is always
    # a method.

    # another possibility:
    result := self.create
    result.oncreate(x,y)
    
  ]

  # only needed with last possibility
  method oncreate(x',y') [
    x := x'
    y := y'
  ]

main problem:

how do we call a super method?

  does parent.foo call foo on the parent, or the parent method foo on self?
